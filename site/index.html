      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <p>I assumed I needed to use a Map because performs better in scenarios involving frequent additions than an Object.</p>
      <p>
        This approach makes a connection with the Stomp server, subscribes to its destination and using a queue implemented with a Map object renders the info
        received from the server sorted in a table and adding a column using SparkLine
      </p>
      <p>To comply with the requirements, I added Jest for testing purposes and made tests for methods on queue.js and utils.js</p>
      <p>To execute tests run <code>npm test</code> after <code>npm install</code></p>
      <p>
        I would have liked to use react as it is a library which would have efficiently update and re-render the table component isolated from the rest of the
        DOM and is convenient for project maintenance over vanilla DOM manipulation.
